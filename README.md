2. Data Collection:*

3. Text Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text by removing special characters, punctuation, and converting all letters to lowercase.
Tokenize the descriptions into individual words or phrases.
Remove stopwords (common words like "and," "the," "is," etc.) that don't provide much context.

4. Feature Extraction:
Convert the tokenized descriptions into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning models.  For this I used techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

5. Building a Recommender Model:*
Choose a recommendation algorithm. Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering are two common approaches.
   
   *Content-Based Filtering:*
For Music Recommedndation System, content-based filtering can be more suitable since we're focusing on analyzing the song descriptions. This approach recommends items similar audios to those the user has shown interest in.
Calculate similarity scores between audios based on their preprocessed descriptions and feature representations.

6. *User Interaction and Recommendations:*
Allow users to input their preferences, e.g., by providing a sample audio keyword or artist name related to their interests.
Use the selected song description for recommendation.
Rank the songs based on similarity scores and present the top recommendations to the user.
